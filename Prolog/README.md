#Harry_Potter_Poison_Puzzle
Tried to solve Harry's puzzle from the Philosofer's Stone in Prolog.

"I think one is not able to give only one solution for this problem as long as a picture is not provided.", (Meister Nagy, Year 2020)

Conclusion: The Meister is right otherwiese you can not assume that 3 and 6 are the safe poison free bottles.
